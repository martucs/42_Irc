# 42_Irc
Creating our own IRC server in C++

About the project
 -----------------------------
 The goal of this project is to create an IRC server that allows communication between different clients via channels or private chats.
 We did only the mandatory part, but implemented the following commands:

- WELP / HELP
- NICK
- USER
- PASS
- QUIT
- JOIN
- PART
- TOPIC
- INVITE
- KICK
- MODE
- PRIVMSG
- OPER
- DIE
- KILL
- NOTICE
